Different physics layers can be indexed through the PhysicsLayers enum (ex. PhysicsManager::physicsObjects[PhysicsLayers::Dynamic]). New Layers should be added to this enum as needed by the application, new layers should be added before the PhysicsLayerCount placeholder mesh type which is used by the physics manager to keep track of the total number of layers.",

            "Description": "The static layer is used for objects that can collide with other objects but cannot be moved by physics, this would be objects such as terrain, platforms, elevators etc, that may be moved explicitly through code and can interact with other objects but are not affected by physics themselves."
